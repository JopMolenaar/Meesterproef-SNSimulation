# Social Network Simulation
This is a simple social network simulation that simulates the interactions between people in a social network.
## Usage
Open Index.html in a browser to run the simulation. By using the control panel on the left of the graph, you can add either people or content to the graph. Once the nodes are in the graph, you can select them by clicking on them. If a node is selected, you can add friends or let the person read items by clicking on non-selected nodes. Deselect a node by clicking on the selected node again.
## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress. Some functionality might not be fully implemented yet. Over the following weeks, this simulation wil be developed further. The goal is to answer the following research questions with the simulation:

- What is a social network?
- How does information travel through the network?
- How does a recommender system work?

Feel free to fork this project and tinker with it.
